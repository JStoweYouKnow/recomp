# Recomp

**A multi-agent, multimodal AI system built on the full Amazon Nova portfolio** — 8 Nova features (Lite, Sonic, Canvas, Reel, Act, Embeddings, Web Grounding, Extended Thinking) orchestrated into a cohesive body recomposition app. Dynamic agent routing, bidirectional voice streaming, browser automation, and tool-use agentic loops demonstrate Nova's capabilities as a full-stack AI platform.

Built for the [Amazon Nova AI Hackathon](https://amazon-nova.devpost.com).

**Repository:** [github.com/JStoweYouKnow/recomp](https://github.com/JStoweYouKnow/recomp)

## Quick Start for Judges

> **Live demo:** [https://recomp-one.vercel.app](https://recomp-one.vercel.app)
>
> 1. Click **"Try pre-seeded demo user"** — no setup needed
> 2. Dashboard loads instantly with 7 days of sample data
> 3. Try: **Log a meal** (text/voice/photo) → **Reco AI coach** (tap the Reco button) → **Weekly review** (Dashboard → Generate)
> 4. All 8 Nova features work out of the box in demo mode
>
> **Health check:** `GET /api/judge/health` — returns status of all integrations (Bedrock, DynamoDB, Act service, wearables)
>
> **Act service status:** `GET /api/act/status` — confirms whether Nova Act grocery/nutrition automation is live or falling back to demo mode

---

## Why This Architecture Matters

Most Nova integrations use one or two models for text generation. Recomp demonstrates how the **entire Nova portfolio** can be composed into a single cohesive experience:

- **Multi-agent orchestration** with dynamic routing — the coordinator examines available data and selectively invokes specialist agents, each using Bedrock Converse tool-use loops
- **Bidirectional voice streaming** via Nova Sonic — real-time audio-in, audio-out for conversational onboarding and an AI coach
- **Browser automation** via Nova Act — grocery search with one-tap Amazon links; add-to-cart requires local session (see [Nova Act](#nova-act-optional))
- **Multimodal understanding** — plate photos, receipt scans, and text all processed by Nova Lite
- **Extended thinking** for complex reasoning during plan generation

The result: a production-grade app that treats Nova not as a text generator, but as an **AI operating system**.

## Impact

**Evidence & methodology:** The pre-seeded demo (Jordan) uses a 7-day synthetic dataset to demonstrate measurable outcomes: 87% macro adherence, 7/10 AI weekly score, 21 meals logged, 7-day streak. Judges can verify by clicking "Try pre-seeded demo" and "Show metrics" in the Evidence card. This illustrates the app's end-to-end impact without requiring weeks of real usage.

**Community:** Recomp removes cost and complexity barriers—no subscription wall, no trainer required. Voice + photo logging (Nova Sonic, Lite) lets users log meals in seconds vs. manual entry. Multimodal embeddings power "similar meals" so repeat logging is one tap. Web-grounding and Act deliver USDA-backed nutrition without separate apps.

**Enterprise:** Wearable integration (Oura, Fitbit, Apple Health) surfaces sleep, activity, and readiness in one place. Single API for corporate wellness dashboards; no per-user licensing from third-party nutrition APIs. DynamoDB sync supports multi-device and team deployments.

**Differentiators:** (1) 4-way meal logging (text, voice, photo, receipt) in one flow—competitors typically offer 1–2. (2) Dynamic caloric budget that adjusts with activity, not a fixed target. (3) Multi-agent weekly review with web-grounded research and wearable synthesis. (4) Nova Act grocery automation → one-tap Amazon links for plan-aligned ingredients.

**Roadmap:** Open source, self-host, mobile PWA, freemium tier, enterprise licensing.

## Innovation Highlights

What makes Recomp novel — both technically and as a product:

- **Dynamic agent routing** — The weekly review coordinator examines available data (meals, wearables) and selectively invokes specialist agents. No wearable data? Skip the biometrics agent, run research-only. No meals logged? Skip meal analysis. This is genuinely adaptive agentic behavior.
- **Conversational onboarding** — Users can set up their profile via voice conversation with Nova Sonic instead of filling a form. The AI asks questions one at a time, then extracts structured profile data.
- **Dynamic caloric budget** — Log activity to earn calories, or sedentary time to deduct; budget adjusts in real time (not a fixed daily target).
- **AI transformation preview** — Upload a full-body photo; Nova Canvas generates an "after" image based on your goal.
- **Nova Act grocery & nutrition** — The Act service (entrant-built Python bridge deployed on Railway) searches Amazon for diet-plan ingredients and returns one-tap links; add-to-cart requires local session. USDA nutrition via Act or web grounding. If Act is unavailable, grocery falls back to Amazon search links; nutrition to estimated macros.
- **Multi-agent weekly review** — Coordinator + meal analyst + wellness (wearable + web research) + synthesis; parallel execution with tool-call rounds.
- **4-way meal logging** — Text, voice (Nova Sonic), photo (Nova Lite vision), and receipt scan in one flow.

## Judge Access

- **Live demo**: [https://recomp-one.vercel.app/](https://recomp-one.vercel.app/). To deploy your own: [Deploy to Vercel](#deployment-vercel) — `vercel --prod` (requires `vercel login`). Add the deployment URL to your Devpost submission. Configure `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in Vercel dashboard. **For judge demos:** "Try pre-seeded demo" sets an auth cookie via `/api/auth/demo`, so AI routes work even if `REQUIRE_AUTH_FOR_AI=true`; leave it unset/false for best experience.
- **Repo access (if private)**: Add `testing@devpost.com` and `Amazon-Nova-hackathon@amazon.com` as collaborators (GitHub → Settings → Collaborators), or make the repo public.
- **AWS**: For a hosted demo, configure Bedrock credentials in the deployment environment. For local evaluation, judges can run `npm run dev` with their own AWS credentials (see Setup).
- **Demo mode**: When running without auth (e.g., first-time visit or cleared cookies), the app stores data in localStorage and shows a "Demo mode" banner. Complete onboarding to register and sync to the server.
- **Judge reliability mode**: If external services (Act, Reel, DynamoDB) are flaky during evaluation, set `JUDGE_MODE=true` in Vercel env to force deterministic fallback. Demos then run without Act service, S3, or DynamoDB. Verify at `/api/judge/health`. The app also degrades gracefully when Act fails—grocery returns search links; nutrition returns estimated macros.
- **Submission**: Demo video (~3 min, #AmazonNova), live URL, repo access, Devpost form.

### 2-minute golden path (judges)

1. Open app and click **Try pre-seeded demo user (instant dashboard)** on landing.
2. Dashboard loads with Jordan's 7-day data. Click **Show metrics** in the "Evidence & Results" card.
3. Open Meals and add one text meal.
4. Return to Dashboard and click **Generate** in Weekly AI Review (multi-agent demo).
5. Open Reco (🧩) and send one text message, or switch to **Voice** and hold the mic for Nova Sonic.

If optional integrations are unavailable, set `JUDGE_MODE=true` for deterministic fallback. Verify with `GET /api/judge/health`.

### How to Evaluate (judges)

Suggested flow to assess all Nova features (~5–10 min):

1. **Onboarding** — Fill the form and submit. Plan generation uses Nova Lite with extended thinking (`invokeNovaWithExtendedThinking` in `src/lib/nova.ts`) for complex multi-day plan reasoning.
2. **Dashboard** — "Today at a Glance" (budget, macros, today's workout/diet), unified calendar with diet/workout popups and "Edit plan," transformation preview (upload photo → "after" image via Nova Canvas).
3. **Meals / Workouts** — Use the calendar to pick a date; view or edit that day's meals or workout. On Workouts, use "Show demo" / "Hide demo" for inline exercise GIFs.
4. **Meals — Log a meal** — Try **Voice log** (Nova Sonic) or **Snap plate** (Nova Lite image), or **Auto-fill nutrition** (Nova Act or web grounding fallback).
5. **Reco** — Click the 🧩 button; chat with the AI coach (text or voice via Nova Sonic).
6. **Weekly review** — Dashboard → "Generate" in the Weekly AI Review card (multi-agent orchestration).
7. **Adjust** — Navigate to Adjust; add feedback and run plan adjustments (Nova Lite).
8. **Wearables** — Connect Oura/Fitbit or import health data (optional).

## Features

- **Personalized plans** — AI-generated diet and workout plans based on fitness level, goals, restrictions, and more
- **Unified calendar** — Same calendar on Dashboard, Meals, and Workouts; date-based filtering; single-day workout view; "Edit plan" from calendar popups
- **Today at a Glance** — Dashboard hero: caloric budget bar, macro pills, today’s workout and diet mini-cards
- **Exercise demo GIFs** — Inline demos with target muscles on dashboard and Workouts tab; show/hide per exercise
- **Calorie & macro tracking** — Daily targets and progress bars for calories, protein, carbs, and fat
- **Meal logging (4 ways)** — Text, voice (Nova Sonic), photo analysis, and receipt scanning
- **Reco AI Coach** — Conversational fitness coach with text + voice modes (bidirectional Nova Sonic streaming)
- **Agentic Weekly Review** — Multi-agent autonomous analysis: meal patterns, wearable trends, web research, and synthesized recommendations
- **Dynamic plan adjustments** — AI-powered suggestions based on progress, feedback, and wearable data
- **Receipt scanning** — Photograph a grocery receipt, Nova extracts food items with estimated macros
- **Wearable connectivity** — Oura Ring, Fitbit, Apple Watch (HealthKit bridge), Health Connect (import)
- **Nova Act automation** — Grocery search → Amazon product links; USDA nutrition lookup. Add-to-cart in cloud = links; true automation requires local session.
- **Nova Labs** — Explore Canvas image generation, Reel video generation, multimodal embeddings, and web grounding
- **DynamoDB persistence** — Server-side storage with cookie-based auth; falls back to localStorage when offline
- **Demo mode indicator** — When using the app without auth (localStorage only), a banner shows "Demo mode — Data stored locally"
- **Offline support** — Error boundaries and local-first design
- **Accessibility** — Skip link, landmarks (banner, main, nav), aria-labels on interactive elements, focus management

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, React 19)
- **Amazon Nova 2 Lite** — Plan generation, meal suggestions, photo analysis, Reco coach, weekly review agent
- **Amazon Nova 2 Sonic** — Bidirectional streaming voice for Reco chat and meal logging
- **Amazon Nova Canvas** — AI image generation
- **Amazon Nova Reel** — AI video generation (requires S3)
- **Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings** — Text/image similarity
- **Amazon Nova Act** — Browser UI automation (Python SDK, with demo-mode fallback)
- **Amazon DynamoDB** — Single-table design for user profiles, meals, plans, milestones, wearable data
- **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, **Zod** validation
- **Vitest** + Testing Library for unit tests

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS account** with access to Amazon Bedrock
2. **Nova 2 Lite** model enabled in Bedrock ([Bedrock Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock) → Model access)
3. **AWS credentials** configured (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`)
4. **DynamoDB table** (optional — app works without it using localStorage)

## Setup

```bash
cd recomp
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file:

```
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=RecompTable

# Optional — Web grounding (research / nutrition lookup)
BEDROCK_NOVA_WEB_GROUNDING_MODEL_ID=us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0
# IAM: add bedrock:InvokeTool on arn:aws:bedrock::{account}:system-tool/amazon.nova_grounding

# Optional — shared rate limiting (recommended for production with family/multiple users)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://xxx.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=xxx

# Optional
NOVA_REEL_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
FITBIT_CLIENT_ID=...
FITBIT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
APPLE_HEALTH_INGEST_KEY=...
NOVA_ACT_API_KEY=...
JUDGE_MODE=false

# Optional — require auth for AI routes (rico, weekly review, meals/suggest, research, images, video, embeddings)
# Set to true in production to prevent anonymous abuse of Bedrock. Default false for hackathon demo compatibility.
REQUIRE_AUTH_FOR_AI=false
```

Configure AWS credentials (e.g. `~/.aws/credentials` or environment variables).

If your Bedrock account requires inference profiles (instead of on-demand model IDs), set:

```
BEDROCK_NOVA_LITE_MODEL_ID=us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0
```

You can also use a full inference profile ARN.

### DynamoDB Table (optional)

1. Create IAM user with DynamoDB permissions (`dynamodb:*` on `RecompTable`).
2. Run: `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=... AWS_REGION=us-east-1 && npm run dynamo:create-table`
3. Add `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=RecompTable` to Vercel env.

**Schema:** Single-table design. PK/SK patterns: `USER#{userId}#PROFILE`, `USER#{userId}#MEAL#{date}#{id}`, `USER#{userId}#PLAN`, etc. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Nova Act (optional)

Nova Act powers nutrition lookup and grocery automation.

**API key (required):** Get from [nova.amazon.com/act → Dev Tools](https://nova.amazon.com/act?tab=dev_tools). Add `NOVA_ACT_API_KEY` to `.env.local`.

**Local:** `pip install nova-act`. Nutrition/grocery work via Python subprocess. Add-to-cart needs one-time `scripts/setup_amazon_login.py`; set `NOVA_ACT_USER_DATA_DIR`.

**Production:** Act does not run on Vercel (no Python). Deploy `act-service/` to Railway/Render:

```bash
cd recomp && railway login && railway up
railway variable set NOVA_ACT_API_KEY=your-key
```

Generate domain in Railway → Settings → Networking. Add `ACT_SERVICE_URL=https://your-act.up.railway.app` to Vercel.

**Troubleshooting:** "Authentication Failed" → set `NOVA_ACT_API_KEY`. "Python not found" → set `ACT_PYTHON` to full path. Nutrition returns estimated → install `nova-act`, restart.

### Known Limitations

| Feature | Works without | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| **Demo mode** | Yes | Full app with localStorage; no server sync |
| **Plan generation** | Bedrock credentials | Requires AWS + Nova Lite; fails with clear error if missing |
| **Meal logging** | Yes | Text always works; voice/photo need Bedrock |
| **Nutrition lookup** | Yes | Act → USDA when `nova-act` installed; otherwise web grounding or estimated fallback |
| **Grocery Act** | `nova-act` + profile | Without: returns demo results; add-to-cart needs Amazon login setup |
| **Nova Reel (video)** | S3 bucket | Set `NOVA_REEL_S3_BUCKET` for live generation; without it, returns demo video fallback |
| **Transformation preview** | Bedrock + Nova Canvas | Upload photo → generate "after" image |
| **DynamoDB sync** | Optional | App works with localStorage only; table needed for cross-device sync |
| **Judge reliability mode** | Yes | Set `JUDGE_MODE=true` to force deterministic fallback for optional integrations and use `/api/judge/health` to verify status |
| **Web grounding** | IAM + US CRIS profile | Requires `bedrock:InvokeTool` on `arn:aws:bedrock::{account}:system-tool/amazon.nova_grounding`; uses `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0` by default. Falls back to Nova Lite if unavailable. |

**Web grounding IAM:** Add this statement to your IAM policy (replace `526015377909` with your AWS account ID):

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["bedrock:InvokeTool"],
  "Resource": ["arn:aws:bedrock:526015377909:system-tool/amazon.nova_grounding"]
}
```

**Amazon login for add-to-cart:** To add grocery items to your Amazon cart, Nova Act needs a persisted browser profile with your login. One-time setup:

```bash
# Nova Act API key required (get from nova.amazon.com/act → Dev Tools)
export NOVA_ACT_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Create profile dir and log in (browser will open)
export NOVA_ACT_USER_DATA_DIR=~/nova-act-amazon-profile
python3 scripts/setup_amazon_login.py
# Log into Amazon in the browser, then press Enter

# Add to .env so the app reuses the profile
echo "NOVA_ACT_USER_DATA_DIR=$HOME/nova-act-amazon-profile" >> .env
```

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Tests

```bash
npm test            # run once
npm run test:watch  # watch mode
```

## Deployment (Vercel)

```bash
# First time: install and log in
npm install -g vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

Set environment variables in the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) → Project → Settings → Environment Variables:

- `AWS_REGION` (e.g. `us-east-1`)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- Optionally: `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME`, `NOVA_REEL_S3_BUCKET`

Add the deployment URL to your Devpost submission and to the Judge Access section above.

### Scalability & Cost

- **Serverless**: Next.js API routes run on Vercel (60s Hobby, 300s Pro). Plan generation and weekly review may take 30–60s; Pro recommended for demos.
- **Bedrock costs**: Nova Lite, Sonic, Canvas, Reel billed per token/image/video. Typical: ~$0.01–0.05 per plan, ~$0.001 per meal suggestion.
- **DynamoDB**: On-demand capacity; set billing alarms.
- **Troubleshooting**: AI 401 → unset `REQUIRE_AUTH_FOR_AI` or use "Try pre-seeded demo". Plan/voice disabled → configure AWS credentials. Without credentials → `JUDGE_MODE=true` for fallbacks.

### Performance Benchmarks

Measured on Vercel Pro (us-east-1), Nova 2 Lite, typical payloads:

| Operation | Latency | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Plan generation** (extended thinking) | 15–45s | Depends on profile complexity; extended thinking adds ~10s |
| **Meal suggestion** | 2–4s | Single Nova Lite call |
| **Photo analysis** (plate → macros) | 3–6s | Image upload + Nova Lite vision |
| **Receipt scanning** | 4–8s | Multi-item extraction |
| **Voice parse** (transcript → macros) | 1–3s | Text-only Nova Lite call |
| **Reco AI coach** (text) | 2–5s | Context-aware single turn |
| **Reco voice** (Nova Sonic streaming) | <1s first token | Bidirectional streaming; latency = time-to-first-audio |
| **Weekly review** (multi-agent) | 20–60s | 3–4 agent rounds with tool calls; wearable + web research adds time |
| **Nova Canvas** (image generation) | 8–15s | Single image |
| **Nova Act** (grocery search) | 30–90s | Browser automation; Railway cold start adds ~15s |
| **Dashboard load** (hydrated) | <200ms | localStorage primary; server sync in background |

**Vercel Hobby vs Pro:** Plan generation and weekly review may timeout on Hobby tier (60s limit). Pro tier (300s limit) recommended for demos. `maxDuration = 60` configured on long-running routes.

## Amazon Nova Integration — All 8 Features

Recomp integrates the full Amazon Nova portfolio:

| # | Feature | Model/Service | Where |
|---|---------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | **Nova 2 Sonic (Voice)** | `amazon.nova-sonic-v1:0` | Reco chat — real-time bidirectional streaming: audio chunks stream to Bedrock during recording, response text/audio streamed back. Voice meal logging in Meals tab. |
| 2 | **Multimodal Embeddings** | `amazon.nova-2-multimodal-embeddings-v1:0` | Nova Labs — embed text for similarity/RAG |
| 3 | **Nova 2 Lite Image Input** | `amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0` | Snap plate in Meals → photo analysis & macro estimates. Receipt scanning → grocery item extraction. |
| 4 | **Web Grounding** | Nova 2 Lite + `nova_grounding` | `/api/research` — search web for nutrition/fitness info. Used by weekly review agent. |
| 5 | **Nova Canvas** | `amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0` | Nova Labs — generate meal/workout inspiration images |
| 6 | **Nova Reel** | `amazon.nova-reel-v1:1` | Nova Labs — generate 6s exercise demo videos (requires S3) |
| 7 | **Extended Thinking** | Nova 2 Lite reasoning config | Plan generation uses high reasoning effort |
| 8 | **Nova Act** | Nova Act SDK (Python) | Nova Labs — browser automation for grocery search & USDA nutrition lookup. Demo-mode fallback when SDK not installed. |

### Agentic Architecture

The weekly review uses a **multi-agent orchestration** pattern:

- **Coordinator Agent** — Routes tasks and synthesizes the final review
- **Meal Analysis Agent** — Analyzes meal patterns, macro adherence, consistency
- **Wellness Agent** — Reviews wearable data (sleep, activity, heart rate trends) and researches current guidelines via web grounding
- **Synthesis Agent** — Generates actionable recommendations from all agent outputs

Each agent uses Nova 2 Lite Converse API with tool use. The coordinator orchestrates up to 5 rounds of tool calls before producing the final review.

### Wearables

| Device | Method |
|--------|--------|
| **Oura Ring** | Personal Access Token from cloud.ouraring.com |
| **Fitbit** | OAuth (set `FITBIT_CLIENT_ID`, `FITBIT_CLIENT_SECRET`) |
| **Apple Watch** | HealthKit SDK bridge sync (iOS companion) or JSON import |
| **Android / Health Connect** | Import export, or use Fitbit if your watch syncs there |
| **Garmin** | Garmin Health API (developer approval required) — import supported |

### Security

- **Rate limiting** on all API routes (fixed-window). Uses **Upstash Redis** when `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` are set; otherwise in-memory (per-instance on Vercel). For production with multiple users, [create an Upstash Redis](https://console.upstash.com/redis) and add the env vars to Vercel.
- **Judge mode** (`JUDGE_MODE=true`): Forces deterministic fallbacks for Nova Act, Nova Reel, DynamoDB, and wearables. Use when optional integrations are unavailable (e.g. no Act service, no S3 for Reel). Ensures demos run reliably without external dependencies. Check status at `GET /api/judge/health`.
- **Zod schema validation** on registration and voice input
- **Cookie-based auth** (httpOnly `recomp_uid` cookie)
- **Input sanitization** on AI context payloads
- **Error boundaries** and graceful fallbacks throughout

## Hackathon Category

**Freestyle** (recommended) — Recomp integrates all 8 Nova features in one cohesive app. Breadth of integration is the differentiator.

**Agentic AI** (alternative) — The weekly review uses a multi-agent orchestration pattern where a coordinator delegates to specialist agents (meal analyst, wellness, synthesizer), each using Nova tool-use to autonomously gather and analyze data.
