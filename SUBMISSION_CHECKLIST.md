## 5. Testing Instructions (for judges)

Include this in your Devpost **Testing instructions** field:

### 2-minute golden path

1. Open the live URL.
2. Click **Try pre-seeded demo user (instant dashboard)** on the landing page.
3. Dashboard loads with Jordan's 7-day data. Click **Show metrics** in the "Evidence & Results" card.
4. Go to **Meals** → add one text meal.
5. Return to **Dashboard** → click **Generate** in the Weekly AI Review card (multi-agent demo).
6. Click the **🧩 Reco** button → send one text message, or switch to **Voice** and hold the mic to try Nova Sonic.

### Optional (5–10 min) — full Nova feature tour

- **Voice onboarding**: Reset demo, then choose "Voice" instead of "Form" and answer Reco's questions out loud.
- **Plan generation**: Reset demo, fill the form, submit — Nova Lite generates diet + workout plan.
- **Transformation preview**: Dashboard → upload a full-body photo → "Generate after image" (Nova Canvas).
- **Shopping list**: Dashboard → load from plan → send to Amazon (Nova Act; demo fallback if Act unavailable).
- **Nova Labs**: Meals → Snap plate (Nova Lite vision) or Receipt scan; Adjust → "Add latest guidelines" (Nova research).

### For judges: what to expect (cloud deployment)

- **Nova Act (grocery)**: Returns Amazon product/search links. One-tap links open in the user's browser (logged into Amazon). Add-to-cart in the cloud = links only; true automation requires a local session.
- **Nova Reel (video)**: S3 for live generation. Without S3, returns demo video fallback (no 503). Judge health shows status.
- **Plan generation / Weekly review**: May take 30–60s. Vercel Pro (300s timeout) recommended for demos; Hobby (60s) usually suffices.

### Verify health

- `GET /api/judge/health` — confirms plan, voice, Reel, Act, etc. status.
- Run `npm run test:production` (or `./scripts/production-smoke-test.sh [BASE_URL]`) to smoke-test production before submission.

## 6. Screenshots & Verification

- [ ] Take 1–3 screenshots: Dashboard (with Evidence card), Meals (voice/photo flow), Reco chat
- [ ] Add screenshots to Devpost submission
- [ ] Verify demo mode: visit live URL in incognito → "Demo mode" banner and full app
- [ ] Verify golden path end-to-end
