# Recomp: Impact & Adoption

Enterprise and community impact, use cases, and post-hackathon roadmap.

---

## Target Community

**Primary users:** Adults pursuing body recomposition (build muscle, lose fat) who want:
- Personalized guidance without hiring a coach
- Low-friction meal logging (voice, photo, receipt — not manual entry)
- Integration with devices they already wear (Oura, Fitbit, Apple Watch)
- One app instead of 5+ siloed fitness/nutrition tools

**Underserved:** People who find generic calorie apps tedious, lack access to personal trainers, or have dietary restrictions that mainstream apps handle poorly.

## Community Impact

| Benefit | How Recomp Delivers |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Accessibility** | Voice + photo + receipt logging; no typing required. Works on any device with a browser. |
| **Cost** | No per-use fees; only AWS usage. No subscription paywall for core features. |
| **Personalization** | AI plans adapt to fitness level, goals, restrictions, injuries, equipment, and schedule. |
| **Reduced friction** | Nova Act grocery automation; cooking app webhooks; wearable sync — less manual data entry. |
| **Motivation** | Reco AI coach, milestones, streak tracking, transformation preview (AI “after” image). |

| **Navigation** | Unified calendar (dashboard, Meals, Workouts) with date-based filtering; "Today at a Glance" and inline exercise demo GIFs reduce context-switching. |

## Enterprise Use Cases

| Segment | Use Case | Value |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Employers** | Corporate wellness programs | Single app for nutrition + fitness + wearables; reduces app sprawl; Nova-powered, no per-seat AI licensing complexity |
| **Health plans** | Member engagement | Wearable integration (Oura, Fitbit, Apple Health) for objective data; AI-driven nudges; HIPAA-ready architecture possible |
| **Gyms & studios** | Member retention | Personalized plans + Reco coach; members stay engaged between sessions |
| **Telehealth** | Dietitian / coach tooling | Clinicians can reference AI-generated plans; meal logging via voice/photo reduces patient burden |

## Post-Hackathon Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Open source** | Q2 2026 | Public repo; contribution guidelines; community Discord/Slack |
| **Self-host option** | Q2 2026 | Docker Compose + Terraform for AWS; one-click deploy for orgs |
| **Mobile PWA** | Q3 2026 | Offline-first PWA; installable; push for milestones |
| **Partnerships** | Q3–Q4 2026 | Integrations with Cronometer, MyFitnessPal, Trainerize; health plan pilots |
| **Research** | Ongoing | Publish results on Nova multi-agent patterns; body recomposition adherence studies |

---

## Adoption Strategy

1. **Developer community**: Publish architecture docs, Nova integration patterns, and multi-agent design on builder.aws.com.
2. **Fitness creators**: Offer early access to influencers/trainers for feedback and case studies.
3. **Enterprise pilots**: Engage 2–3 wellness programs for 90-day trials with anonymized usage insights.
4. **OSS sustainment**: Accept sponsorships (GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective) to fund hosting and maintenance.
